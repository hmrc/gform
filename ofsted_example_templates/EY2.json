However the term associated may not be as clear/ plain English as connected?\n\nOther notes\n\nThe following also need doing once the form content is finalised:\n\n\nAcknowledgement page text (this may need to mirror some of the confirmation email content (which Mac is working) - as this often details what happens next/what a user needs to do next.
