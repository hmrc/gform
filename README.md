### Uploading sample data

Upload a form template:

    curl http://localhost:9196/gform/formtemplates -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '@sample-data/template-aaa999.json'

Upload eeitt test data: 
    
    curl --data-binary '@sample-data/EEITTTestUsers.txt' http://localhost:9191/eeitt/etmp-data/live/business-users
        
Aside from a local service, the backend needs to be accessed through the frontend proxy, to try this locally:

    curl -s http://localhost:9195/submissions/test-only/proxy-to-gform/gform/formtemplates -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-requested-with: foo" -d '@sample-data/template-aaa999.json'
    
(Note that you will need to have configured your local gform-frontend for test only routes and CSRF bypass, as in for example app-config-dev
